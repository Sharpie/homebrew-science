# NOTE:
#
# Two exciting enhancements in GCC 4.6.0 are currently unavailable.
#
# Link-time optimization (LTO) is broken due to changes in XCode 3.2.6 and 4.0.
# This should be fixed in GCC 4.6.1:
#   http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-dev/2011-March/014278.html
#
# (LTO doesn't seem to be fixed even in 4.6.2)
#
# GCC 4.6.0 adds the gccgo compiler for the Go language. However, gccgo "is
# currently known to work on GNU/Linux and RTEMS. Solaris support is in
# progress. It may or may not work on other platforms."
#
# It does not work on OS X. Yet.
